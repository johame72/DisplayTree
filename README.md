# DisplayTree PowerShell Script

## Overview

The `DisplayTree.ps1` is a PowerShell script designed to display a tree-like directory structure of a given directory. It is especially tailored for projects and can be run from any location. The script displays both directories and files, and also writes this structure to a text file with a unique ISO Date-Time prefix. It includes an exception to show the `node_modules` directory without diving into its internal structure.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 or compatible Windows version
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher

## Features

- Displays a tree-like structure of directories and files
- Outputs the structure to a uniquely named text file with an ISO Date-Time prefix
- Can be run from any directory
- Special handling for `node_modules` directory to prevent excessive nesting

## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. Save `DisplayTree.ps1` in a directory of your choice.
2. (Optional) Add the directory to your system's PATH or create a PowerShell alias for easy access.

### Running the Script

1. Open PowerShell terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory you wish to scan.
3. Run `.\DisplayTree.ps1` or use the alias if you set one up.

The script will display the directory structure in the terminal and save it to a text file in the current directory.
